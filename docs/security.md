## docs/security.md

This file outlines the security considerations and best practices for the Streamlined Digital Library Backend MVP. It's crucial to ensure the system is secure, protecting user data and maintaining trust.

### 1.  Security Principles

**Defense-in-Depth:** Implement security measures at multiple layers of the application, from data validation to secure communication.
**Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, limiting potential damage from unauthorized access.
**Secure Configuration:**  Implement secure configurations for all components, including databases, web servers, and external services.
**Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Book Data:** 
    - Validate ISBN format using a regex or dedicated library.
    - Sanitize title, author, and description to prevent XSS attacks.
- **User Data:**
    - Validate username, email, and password using appropriate patterns.
    - Hash passwords securely using `passlib` (version 1.7.4) as implemented in `src/domain/users/models/user.py`.
    -  Sanitize user-provided text fields for potential XSS vulnerabilities. 

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Token Authentication:**  
    - Implement robust JWT token authentication as defined in `src/utils/jwt_utils.py`.
    -  Securely store the secret key in the `.env` file.
    -  Implement JWT token validation and generation using the `jwt` (version 2.6.0) library.
- **Role-Based Access Control:**  
    -  Define distinct roles (`staff`, `patron`) in `src/domain/users/models/user.py`. 
    -  Use roles to control access to sensitive features (e.g., book management).

### 4. Secure Communication

- **HTTPS Enforcement:**  
    - Ensure the application is deployed behind HTTPS for secure communication.
    -  Use a web server like Nginx or Apache to enforce HTTPS.
- **Secure Headers:**
    - Implement security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, HTTP Strict Transport Security) to mitigate XSS and other attacks.

### 5. Database Security

- **Database Encryption:** Consider encrypting sensitive data stored in PostgreSQL using database-level encryption.
- **Secure Database Configuration:**  
    -  Implement secure database configurations for PostgreSQL as outlined in `src/infrastructure/database/engine.py`.
    -  Store database credentials securely in the `.env` file.

### 6.  Session Management

- **Stateless Authentication:**  
    -  Implement stateless authentication using JWT tokens as described in `src/domain/users/services/user_service.py`.
    -  Avoid storing sensitive session information in the server.

### 7.  Logging

- **Secure Logging:** 
    -  Implement logging as defined in `src/utils/logger.py`.
    -  Log only necessary information and avoid logging sensitive data directly.
    -  Mask sensitive information like passwords and API keys.
    -  Consider using secure logging solutions like Graylog or Splunk for centralized logging. 

### 8. Error Handling

- **Informative Error Messages:**  
    -  Implement informative error messages for API responses.
    -  Use custom exceptions defined in `src/utils/exceptions.py` to provide context-specific error messages. 
- **Graceful Error Handling:**  
    -  Handle errors gracefully and prevent the application from crashing.
    -  Log errors for debugging and monitoring. 

### 9.  Regular Updates and Audits

- **Security Patches:**  
    -  Stay updated on security patches for all software components.
    -  Implement a process for applying security updates regularly.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:**  
    -  Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses.

### 10. Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing:**  
    -  Conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities.
- **Code Reviews:**  
    -  Perform code reviews to ensure adherence to secure coding practices.
- **Integration Tests:**  
    -  Write integration tests to ensure security measures are working as intended.

### 11.  Monitoring and Alerting

- **Security Monitoring:**  
    -  Implement security monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity and potential attacks.
- **Alerting:**  
    -  Configure alerts for critical security events.

### 12.  User Education

- **Security Best Practices:**
    -  Educate users about secure password practices and common security threats.
    -  Provide users with guidelines for protecting their accounts and data.

### 13.  Security Standards

- **OWASP Top 10:**  
    -  Ensure that the application addresses the OWASP Top 10 security risks.
    -  Refer to the OWASP Top 10 website for detailed information about common vulnerabilities: [https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

### 14.  Security Configuration

- **Environment Variables:**  
    -  Store sensitive configurations (e.g., database credentials, API keys) in a secure `.env` file.
    -  Use the `dotenv` (version 0.21.0) library to load environment variables as shown in `src/config/settings.py`. 

### 15.  Future Considerations

- **Security Analysis Tools:** 
    -  Integrate security analysis tools into the development workflow to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
- **Security Training:**  
    -  Provide security training to development team members to enhance their understanding of secure coding practices.
- **Secure Development Lifecycle:** 
    -  Implement a secure development lifecycle (SDL) process to build security into every stage of development.

This security documentation provides a comprehensive foundation for building a secure Streamlined Digital Library Backend MVP. By following these principles and best practices, you can create a robust and secure application that safeguards user data and fosters trust.
