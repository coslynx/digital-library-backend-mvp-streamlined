## docs/architecture.md

This file outlines the architecture and design of the Streamlined Digital Library Backend MVP, explaining the overall structure, key components, and how they interact to deliver the desired functionality. 

### 1.  File Purpose and Implementation Details:

- **Role within the MVP:** This file serves as the primary documentation for the architecture of the Streamlined Digital Library Backend MVP. It explains the design decisions, key components, and interactions that shape the application's structure and behavior. 
- **Features and Functionalities:**
    - **High-Level Architecture Breakdown:** The Streamlined Digital Library Backend follows a layered architecture, dividing the application into distinct layers for clear separation of concerns. This approach promotes code organization, reusability, and easier maintenance.
    - **Component Interactions:** The application consists of several key components:
        - **API (FastAPI):** Provides endpoints for interacting with the library system via RESTful API calls.
        - **Controllers:** Handle incoming requests, validate data, and orchestrate the flow of information between API routes and services.
        - **Services:** Encapsulate business logic, handling core functionalities like book management, user authentication, and loan processing.
        - **Repositories:** Facilitate interaction with the database (PostgreSQL), providing data persistence and retrieval operations for books and users.
        - **Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores and manages data, acting as the central repository for all information.
    - **Data Flow:** Data flows through the application in a well-defined manner:
        1. **API Request:** Clients (e.g., web applications) send requests to the FastAPI API endpoints.
        2. **Controller:** Requests are received by controllers, which perform validation and orchestrate the interaction with services.
        3. **Service:** Controllers delegate requests to services, which implement the core business logic.
        4. **Repository:** Services utilize repositories to interact with the database, retrieving or persisting data as required.
        5. **Database:** The PostgreSQL database stores and manages data, ensuring consistent data access across components.
        6. **API Response:** The controller generates responses based on the results and sends them back through the FastAPI routes to the client.
    - **Key Architectural Decisions:** 
        - **Dependency Injection:** Dependency injection is used to decouple components, promoting modularity, testability, and flexibility for future changes. This allows for easier swapping of implementations and better code organization.
        - **Authentication Mechanisms:** The system employs JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for secure user access to sensitive resources. This ensures a stateless authentication approach, simplifying server-side management.
        - **API Design Patterns:**  The API follows RESTful principles, ensuring a consistent and predictable API structure for client interaction.
        - **Scalability Strategy:** The architecture is designed for potential scalability in the future, allowing for horizontal scaling through additional application instances and load balancing. Database scaling can be achieved using PostgreSQL's features like replication and read replicas. 
- **Design Patterns and Architectural Principles:**
    - **Layered Architecture:**  The application is divided into layers for clear separation of concerns, promoting code organization, reusability, and easier maintenance.
    - **Dependency Injection:**  Implement dependency injection to decouple components, improve testability, and enhance flexibility for future changes.
    - **RESTful API Design:**  Employ RESTful principles for the API design, ensuring a consistent and predictable API structure.
    - **MVC or MVVM (Optional):**  Consider implementing MVC or MVVM patterns (if applicable) for the presentation layer to organize the user interface components.
- **User Stories and MVP Requirements:** 
    - **User Story:** As a library staff member, I want to easily add, edit, and manage book entries in the digital library catalog so that I can provide patrons with accurate and up-to-date information.
    - **User Story:** As a library patron, I want to search for books and request loans easily so that I can access library resources conveniently.
    - **User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the system's performance and identify potential issues so that I can maintain optimal service availability.
- **High-Level Pseudocode or Flowchart:** 
    ```
    API Request (e.g., GET /books)
    -> FastAPI Routes (books.py)
    -> Controllers (books_controller.py)
    -> Services (book_service.py)
    -> Repositories (book_repository.py)
    -> Database (PostgreSQL)
    -> Return API Response 
    ```
- **Performance Requirements and Constraints:**
    - The application should be optimized for performance to provide a fast and responsive user experience.
    - The architecture should consider efficient database access and querying.
    - Caching strategies should be implemented to reduce database load and improve response times.
    - Asynchronous operations should be considered for tasks like database interactions or API requests to improve concurrency.
- **Expected Inputs and Outputs:**
    - **Input:** API requests, configuration settings, environment variables, database data.
    - **Output:** API responses, database updates, log messages.

### 4.  Data Management and State Handling:

- **Data Flow:** Data flows from API requests to the FastAPI application instance (`src/infrastructure/api/main.py`). 
    - API requests are routed to the appropriate endpoints defined in the `src/infrastructure/api/v1/routes` directory (e.g., `books.py`, `users.py`, `auth.py`).
    - The routes pass requests to the controllers (e.g., `books_controller.py`, `users_controller.py`, `auth_controller.py`), which handle the business logic for the request.
    - Controllers call the services (e.g., `book_service.py`, `user_service.py`) to perform specific operations. 
    - Services utilize repositories (e.g., `book_repository.py`, `user_repository.py`) to interact with the PostgreSQL database. 
    - Data is retrieved or persisted in the database using SQLAlchemy. 
    - Responses are generated by the controllers, sent back through the routes, and returned to the client.
- **Local State:**  The application primarily relies on stateless authentication, using JWT tokens. 
    - JWT tokens are generated in `src/utils/jwt_utils.py` and validated in `src/infrastructure/api/v1/routes/auth.py`.
    - Local state is minimal, primarily used for caching or temporary data storage within functions or classes.
- **Caching:**  Caching is not implemented in the MVP.
- **Shared State:** The database (PostgreSQL) acts as the central repository for shared state, ensuring that data is consistently accessed across components. 
- **Data Validation and Sanitization:**  
    - **Input Validation:**  Use Pydantic models to validate incoming API requests and ensure data integrity. Define validation rules using Pydantic's `validator` decorator or custom validation logic. 
    - **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize user input (especially text fields) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Use a sanitization library like `bleach` or implement custom sanitization logic. 
    - **Sensitive Data:** Implement robust password hashing using `passlib` (version 1.7.4) for user passwords. 

### 5. API Interactions and Network Requests:

- **Google Books API:**
    - **Endpoint:**  [https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes)
    - **HTTP Method:** GET
    - **Request Payload:** Query parameters (e.g., `q`, `isbn`, `title`) to search for books.
    - **Response Scenarios:**
        - **Success:** Returns a JSON object containing book details (title, author, ISBN, cover image, etc.).
        - **Error:**  Returns an HTTP error code and message (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request).
    - **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling to catch HTTP errors (e.g., `requests.exceptions.RequestException`). 
        - Log error messages and details.
        -  Return appropriate error responses to the client.
        -  Implement retries (with exponential backoff) for transient network errors.
    - **Authentication:**  Requires an API key (stored securely in the `.env` file).
    - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent exceeding the API's usage limits. 
        -  Use a library like `ratelimit` to manage request rates. 
    - **Mock API:**  For testing and development, use a mocking library (e.g., `unittest.mock`) to mock API responses to simulate API interactions.

### 6.  Error Handling, Logging, and Debugging:

        - Error messages and stack traces
        - API request details (method, endpoint, request payload)
    - **Sensitive Data:** 
        - Avoid logging sensitive information directly in logs.
        - Use techniques like string masking or redacting to protect passwords, API keys, or other confidential data.
- **Debugging:**
    - **Debug Flags:**  Use environment variables (e.g., `DEBUG=True` in the `.env` file) to enable or disable debug logging.
    - **Console Outputs:** Use `print` statements or logging at the `DEBUG` level to output helpful debugging information.
    - **Performance Monitoring:**  Consider using a profiling tool (e.g., `cProfile`) to measure code execution times and identify potential performance bottlenecks.

### 7.  Performance Optimization Techniques:

    - **Database Queries:**  Inefficient database queries can significantly impact performance.
    - **API Requests:** Excessive API requests (especially if not rate-limited) can lead to performance issues. 
    - **Data Serialization and Deserialization:**  Converting data between formats (e.g., Python objects, JSON) can consume resources. 
- **Optimization Strategies:** 
    - **Database Query Optimization:** 
        - **Indexes:** Create indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `isbn`, `title`, `author`) in the PostgreSQL database.
        - **Prepared Statements:**  Use prepared statements with SQLAlchemy to improve query efficiency. 
        - **Query Optimization Techniques:**  Use SQLAlchemy's query optimization features and analyze query plans to identify areas for improvement. 
    - **API Request Optimization:** 
        - **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting (e.g., using `ratelimit` library) to prevent exceeding the API's usage limits.
        - **Caching:**  Cache API responses (e.g., using `cachetools` or `Redis`) to reduce the number of requests.
    - **Data Serialization and Deserialization:** 
        - **Efficient Serialization:**  Use libraries like `ujson` for fast JSON serialization. 
        - **Lazy Loading:**  Use SQLAlchemy's lazy loading feature to load related data only when it's needed.
    - **Asynchronous Operations:**  Utilize asynchronous operations (e.g., using `asyncio` or `aiohttp`) for tasks like database interactions or API requests to improve concurrency and responsiveness.
- **Performance Benchmarks and Metrics:**
    - **API Request Latency:**  Measure the time it takes for API requests to be processed. 
    - **Database Query Execution Time:** Monitor the time it takes for database queries to complete.

    - **CPU Optimization:**  Use efficient algorithms and data structures. Profile code to identify CPU bottlenecks.
    - **Network Optimization:**  Implement rate limiting for API requests. Use connection pooling for efficient database connections. 

### 8.  Security Measures and Data Protection:

- **Security Considerations:** 
    - **Authentication and Authorization:**  A secure authentication system is crucial for protecting user data and ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources. 
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate all user input to prevent attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Sanitize data to remove potentially malicious content. 
    - **Secure Communication:**  Use HTTPS for secure communication between the client and server, protecting data in transit.
    - **Database Security:**  Use PostgreSQL's built-in security features (e.g., encryption, role-based access control) to protect data at rest. 
    - **Secure Configuration:**  Store sensitive configurations (e.g., database credentials, API keys) securely in the `.env` file.
    - **Logging:**  Avoid logging sensitive information directly. 
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    - **Book Data:** 
        - **ISBN:** Validate that the ISBN is in a valid format using regular expressions or a dedicated library (e.g., `isbnlib`).
        - **Title, Author, Description:**  Sanitize text fields (e.g., using `bleach` library) to prevent XSS attacks.
    - **User Data:**
        - **Username:**  Validate that the username is alphanumeric and doesn't contain special characters.
        - **Email:**  Validate that the email address is a valid format (using regular expressions).

- **Authentication and Authorization:** 
    - **JWT Authentication:**  Use JWT tokens for authentication, which are generated and verified in `src/utils/jwt_utils.py`. 
    - **Role-Based Access Control:**  Define roles for users (e.g., `staff`, `patron`) in the `src/domain/users/models/user.py` file. 
        - Use these roles to restrict access to specific resources or functionalities. 
- **Common Vulnerabilities:**
    - **XSS:**  Use a template engine (e.g., Jinja2) with proper escaping or a sanitization library (e.g., `bleach`) to prevent XSS attacks.
    - **CSRF:**  Implement CSRF protection by using CSRF tokens and validating HTTP referrers.
