### 4. Data Management and State Handling:

- **Data Flow:** Data flows from API requests to controllers, services, repositories, and finally to the database for persistence. Data is retrieved from the database and passed back through the layers for API responses.
- **State Management:** The application primarily relies on stateless authentication using JWT tokens. 
    - **JWT Token Generation:** Implemented in `src/utils/jwt_utils.py`.
    - **JWT Token Validation:**  Implemented in `src/infrastructure/api/v1/routes/auth.py`.
- **Caching:** Not implemented in the MVP. However, consider implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., popular books) in future iterations to improve performance.
- **Shared State:** The database acts as the central repository for shared state.
- **Data Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement data validation and sanitization in the following areas:
    - **User Data:**  Validate username, email, and password format. Sanitize user-provided text fields to prevent XSS attacks.
    - **Book Data:**  Validate ISBN format. Sanitize title, author, and description to prevent XSS attacks.

### 5. API Interactions and Network Requests:

    - **Endpoint:**  [https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes)
    - **HTTP Method:** GET
    - **Request Payload:** Query parameters (e.g., `q`, `isbn`, `title`) to search for books.
    - **Response Scenarios:**
        - **Success:** Returns a JSON object containing book details.
        - **Error:** Returns an error code and message.
    - **Error Handling:**  Handle errors gracefully and log relevant information. Implement retries with exponential backoff to handle transient network issues.
    - **Authentication:**  Requires an API key, which should be stored securely in the `.env` file. 
    - **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent exceeding the API's rate limits. 
    - **Mock API:**  Use a mocking library (e.g., `unittest.mock`) to mock API interactions for testing and development. 

### 6. Error Handling, Logging, and Debugging:

        - Input validation errors (e.g., invalid ISBN, invalid email format).
    - **Error Messages and Codes:** Use descriptive error messages and HTTP status codes to provide informative feedback to clients.
    - **Error Handling Strategy:**  
        - Log errors for debugging and analysis.
        - Return appropriate error responses to clients.
        - Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., network issues).
        - Raise custom exceptions (e.g., `AuthenticationError`, `DatabaseError`) to provide context-specific error handling.

        - Module name
        - Error messages and stack traces
        - User actions and API requests
    - **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels for different types of events.
    - **Sensitive Data:**  Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and user data directly.
        - **Obfuscation:**  Mask sensitive information in logs using techniques like string masking.
        - **Redacting:** Remove sensitive data from logs before they are stored.
- **Debugging:**

    - **Logging:**  Avoid logging sensitive information directly and mask sensitive data in logs.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    - **User Data:**
        - **Username:**  Validate that the username is alphanumeric and doesn't contain special characters.
        - **Email:**  Validate that the email address is a valid format (using regular expressions).
        - **Password:**  Ensure the password meets minimum length and complexity requirements. Implement strong password hashing using `passlib`.
        - **Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided text fields (e.g., using `bleach`) to prevent XSS attacks. 
    - **Book Data:**
        - **ISBN:**  Validate that the ISBN is in a valid format (e.g., using regular expressions) and that it is unique in the database.
        - **Title, Author, Description:**  Sanitize all text fields to prevent XSS attacks.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - **JWT Authentication:** Implement JWT token generation and validation as described in `src/utils/jwt_utils.py`. 
    - **Role-Based Access Control:**  Define roles (e.g., `staff`, `patron`) in the `User` model (`src/domain/users/models/user.py`) and use them to control access to sensitive features.
- **Common Vulnerabilities:**
    - **XSS:**  Prevent XSS attacks by sanitizing user input and using templating engines securely.
    - **CSRF:**  Protect against CSRF attacks using CSRF tokens and validating HTTP referrers.
